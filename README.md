<p>Bisly is a general purpose discord bot with commands ranging from general to moderation, and from fun to some cute animal commands. With over 45 commands, you won't regret using Bisly.<br>
This new update comes with a new polished code, improved performance and more reliable up-time. Use feedback command <code>b!feedback [your feedback]</code> to inform us about the bugs you encourter, or about any commands you would like to see in Bisly.</p>

<p>You can get list of commands using the help command <code>b!help</code>. To get detailed info about a command by using <code>b!help [commandName]</code>.</p>

Notes :-
>1) For using the welcome-leave logs, there must be a channel named <code>welcome-bye</code> in the server. If the bots finds that channel, the command starts to work automatically.
>2) Logs on Bisly can be used by having a channel named <code>logs</code> in the server. Logs work for deleted messages.
>3) For the reports command to work, there must be a channel named <code>reports</code> in the server. <b>Note:</b> Anyone can use this command. The usage is - <code>b!report [person] [reason]</code>.
>4) The createchannel command can make any type of channel, whether it is text or the voice. Also you can use the bot to create channel categories. The usage is - <code>b!createchannel [name of the channel] [type]</code>.
>5) The deletechannel command can delete any channel in the server. The usage is - <code>b!deletechannel [name/id]</code>. Also in the command, you will have to mention the channel name, instead of just writing out the name of the channel. Also you can use the <code>id</code> of the channel, in place of the name of the channel.
>6) For the ban and kick commands, providing the reason is optional.
>7) For the bulkyt and the yt (both are youtube commands) you should provide enough arguments to get accurate results.
>8) Math command has various use cases. For a detailed list of all cases visit https://github.com/bugwheels94/math-expression-evaluator
